  fullDescription: "Lifegraphy, developed in collaboration with LG Electronics, is a Synthetic Customer Agent (SCA) system that revolutionizes customer research by moving beyond static personas. Built on survey data from 4,000 respondents in South Korea, it generates realistic digital agents that embody distinct customer clusters, such as Smart Innovators or Tasteful Connoisseurs. These agents are created through a structured pipeline that transforms demographic, psychographic, and lifestyle insights into rich profiles, complete with visual representations, enabling businesses to interact with them in natural, conversational ways.\n\nThe platform provides a user-friendly interface where enterprises can generate and manage SCAs, engage with them in interactive chat rooms, and use advanced analysis tools like keyword frequency mapping, emotion analysis, and retrieval-augmented generation for product-specific queries. Offline tests and a four-month field study with 47 global enterprise practitioners demonstrated Lifegraphy's high accuracy (up to 87%) and strong practical value, showing its ability to deliver novel insights, support qualitative research, and reduce time and costs associated with traditional methods.\n\nPractitioner feedback highlighted both the system's strengths and areas for improvement. While Lifegraphy excelled at generating realistic, differentiated customer perspectives, users also requested greater diversity within clusters, enhanced reporting, and clearer data transparency. Future directions focus on balancing accuracy with diversity, expanding datasets for broader cultural coverage, and tailoring the system to specific use cases like ideation and concept testing. Overall, Lifegraphy has proven to be a powerful tool for generating multi-dimensional insights, making customer understanding more dynamic, efficient, and impactful.",
