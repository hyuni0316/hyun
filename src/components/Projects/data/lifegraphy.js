  fullDescription: "This project is a collaboration with LG Electronics. To make large-scale in-depth survey data easier and more flexible to use, we developed synthetic customer agents powered by generative AI. With this system, users can freely create agents, chat with them, and perform additional analyses. We conducted offline tests and a four-month field test, and submitted a related paper.",
