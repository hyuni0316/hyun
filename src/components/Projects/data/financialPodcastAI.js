  fullDescription: 'Current AI podcast services face key limitations: they lack fine-grained prompt control, often produce inaccurate or awkward expressions, and make it difficult to adjust podcast length, playback speed, or voice tone. Content is typically one-off without continuity, and there is no AI podcast service specialized in stocks or economics. To address these gaps, this project focuses on developing and researching a Playground system that leverages asset data (MTS data) and real-time market information to generate personalized AI podcasts, enabling users to experience the creation process and explore optimal settings.',
