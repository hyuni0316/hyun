  fullDescription: 'Emotional interactions with AI are often limited to text-based interfaces, offering little physical or immersive engagement. "INSIDE and OUT" overcomes this by integrating tangible objects and dynamic shadows to represent emotions like curiosity, fear, anger, and love. Using real-time projection mapping, object detection, and voice interaction, the system enables users to explore emotions in a multidimensional way, seamlessly connecting conceptual feelings with physical interaction and redefining sentimental engagement.
