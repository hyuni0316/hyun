  fullDescription: "This product is about redesigning the battery case to enable rapid fire suppression. It quickly and effectively quenches and cools the battery in the early stages of thermal runaway. We designed and prototyped an innovative battery case and pouch mechanism that releases water using wax. Additionally, we conducted battery thermal runaway experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness.",
